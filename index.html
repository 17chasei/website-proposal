    <h2 id="homepage-subtitle">A compendium of the world's writing systems</h2>
    <div id="paragraph">
        <p><span id="welcome">Welcome to <span id="the-written-world">The Written World.</span></span> This website is dedicated to teaching about the many writing systems (or “scripts”) of the world’s languages. Despite writing having only been extant for a fraction of time that humanity has been speaking languages, we have already seen a variety of writing systems come about (and, at times, being invented independently from each other). Writing continuously evolves (just like language), and this is evident in how we write today. It may be strange to consider, for example, that the <a href="">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a> are the reason why the letters I’m using (and you’re reading) right now exist. This, however, is simply one of many incredible aspects of writing. This homepage has two main categories that both ultimately link to the same subjects; this is done for the sake of convenience and navigation.
        </p> 
        <p>If you’re interested in the typological categories of writing, consult the section “Types of Writing Systems.” If you’re interested in the "ancestry" of a writingsystem, check the section “Writing systems invented independently of one another”; this section starts with unrelated writing systems and continues along with their descendants.
        </p>
        <p><em>Please note that some writing systems don't always neatly fit into a category; they may have elements of more than one (such as Cuneiform and some abjads).</em></p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="types">Types of writing systems:</h2>
      <p class="index-links"><a href="">Abjads</a>: Writing systems that tend to omit vowels, giving precedence to consonant letters.</p>
      <p class="index-links"><a href="">Abugidas</a>: Writing systems where vowels are indicated by modifications to a consonant letter.</p>
      <p class="index-links"><a href="">Alphabets</a>: Writing systems that tend to equally indicate both vowels and consonants.</p>
      <p class="index-links"><a href="">Ideographies/pictographies</a>: Writing systems that use abstract symbols to convey ideas (ideograms) and/or pictures to resemble what they refer to (pictograms).</p>
      <p class="index-links"><a href="">Logographies</a>: Writing systems that often use abstract symbols to represent words (logograms). Not to be confused with ideograms/pictograms, which don't refer to any specific word, but rather a broad meaning, or "translingual".</p>
      <p class="index-links"><a href="">Proto-writing</a>: Early forms of writing that didn't convey specific semantic meaning, but more broad concepts, such as clan markers or religious symbols. Many scripts today can be traced to proto-writing of some kind.</p>
      <p class="index-links"><a href="">Semi-syllabaries</a>: Writing systems that have elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary.</p>
      <p class="index-links"><a href="">Syllabaries</a>: Writing systems where each syllable tends to have its own letter.</p>
    <h2 class="types">Writing systems invented independently of one another:</h2>
        <p class="index-links"><a href="">Chinese</a>: The Chinese script and its descendants.</p>
        <p class="index-links"><a href="">Cuneiform</a>: The Sumerian cuneiform script and its descendants.</p>
        <p class="index-links"><a href="">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a>: The Egyptian hieroglyphs and its descendants.</p>
        <p class="index-links"><a href="">Mesoamerican</a>: The various Mesoamerican scripts and their descendants.</p>
